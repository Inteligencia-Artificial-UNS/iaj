## SimulationEngineApp

The application starts at the Main method of SimulationEngineApp.
It creates and initializes an instance of WorldState, and
SimulationEngine.

It also maintains a queue of actions (i.e. a MailBox of instances of
Actions) which is filled with actions by the agent connection handlers
(AgentConnection), called unityActionQueue.
It is so called because this is the queue Unity will pull actions from
to apply their effect. 

## ActionHandler

The ActionHandler simply gathers the functionality that perform the
checks to verify that an action is executable by an agent and applies
an action's effects to the simulation state in the affirmative case.

The ActionHandler implements the simulation logic that checks whether
an action is executable.

The handleAction function is tasked with removing actions from the
ready action queue, checking if they are in fact executable, and if so
calling the applyActionEffects method.

The status of an action, executable or not, must be informed to the
agent who sent it.

This is accomplished by inserting an ActionResult object in the 
action result queue of the corresponding agent's AgentConnection, 
whether or not the action is enqueued in the unity action queue.
